# Bitcoins store of value fallacy
_Bitcoins_ utility and efficiency as a payment method is intensely debated, so when trying to vindicate its intrinsic value, it is often resorted to the use case of _Bitcoin_ as a store of value, which is supposed to explain its high future demand.

Currently, it is even taken as a stand-alone property and considered on par with the mammoth gold, while being decentralized and more secure opposed to all other asset classes outside of the Crypto-Space.

However, _Bitcoin_ only working as a store of value completely discounts the axiom of utility, so while I strongly believe that utility is in some sense imperative for being rated as a store of value, the whole discussion somehow builds on a false premise.</p>
### Store of value
Literally, the term store of value does not nessecarily account for a changing value over time, as long as you can put something aside and use it when retrieved. In a more general sense however, as Wiki cites "[...a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future](https://google.de)". It is exactly what most people think of or find desirable, when they want to save money for times in need. For that definition to hold the exchange rate between the store of value and a basket of goods should remain fairly constant over time.

## The equilibrium of golds steady demand
Since demand only depends on utility, the demand of gold is tied to the utility of gold.
As a noble metal and a raw chemical element, gold has two basic properties that humankind happened to be fond of over centuries:

1.  neat chemical, physical characteristics for technology and engineering¹
2. Shiny look (considered beautiful by a human eye)²

These two traits are completely independent from any external evaluation and form the basis of golds value. Due to its inherent physiognomy and scarcity it is prevalently used as jewelry and show off (prestige), which generates higher prices. Even though it has wonderful chemical and phyiscal characteristics for engineering the price is too high for most appliances and is therefore mostly used for high-end-technology.
Even if the demand of gold in jewelry would somehow decay, due to societal issues or whatever, the diminishing demand in the jewelry industry, hence decreasing the price, would result in the increasing demand of gold in the technological sector.

Our economy works in cycles, where there are times of high spending and times of high savings (of course it presumes our financial system doesn’t fundamentally change over the next decades) and only in times of high savings would demand for a store of value be looked for, leading to a strong correlation.

This would result in an oscillating valuing with high amplitudes and price action would move almost asymmetrically to fiat demand, which is controlled by central banks and the governments. Without any other utility, there is no antagonal force for counterbalancing which is prerequisite in order to have the required (near) constant value.

Assume you have no payment capabilities with _Bitcoin_. And the only utility that can be derived is the decentralized and secure storage immune from government intervention.
Person A buys Bitcoin to store its value in Dollar. Over time the Dollar is inflated so you sell your Bitcoin for more Dollars you bought it with. This makes up for the inflation and you successfully stored your value.
You are obliged to pay your taxes in your local currency so you need to have local currency! The demand of your local currency cannot really decline as long as the government collects taxes. Now the demand of a local currency can increase if individuals from other currency areas want to purchase a good denoted in your local currency.
